When coding came up as a subject in my family, I was lost. A person would talk about arrays, and hashes full of excitement. My response was, "I have no idea what you are talking about." I felt really out of the loop with some of my family. Which made family get togethers, lets say, awkward for me. But, hey no big deal. I had my own thing going. I was good. Then life smacked me with a major curve. Which changed my perspective on my future for not only myself, but my kids. 
So, I began looking into different things that I could do to change things for us. And, I decided on programming. Well, having no previous knowledge of it, I was totally lost at the beginning. I eventually figured out, coding and programming is like chemistry for computers. And chemistry has always been my favorite subject. Things began to click and it was like one huge puzzle I could put together or create. IT IS AWESOME!!! I am glad now that I chose it.
